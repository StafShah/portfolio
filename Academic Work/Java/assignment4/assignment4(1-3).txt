1.
a) When no constructor is explicitly defined in the class
b) An object created without a reference variable
c) When there is an attempt to use a variable that does not point to an object and refers to nothing
d) When a new instance is called in Test (line 3), class A itself does not have default constructor
e) false
f) a) Only if the static method has a reference to an instance to call the instance method(s) on
   b) Yes, you can freely do this
g) There is no problem as the radius is being retrieved within the class itself
h) Primitive types are passed-by-value, which means a copy is taken of the value, whereas references modify the original object in the method
OUTPUT:
count is 101
times is 0
i) No, because there is a getter method for a non-primitive data type
j) The constructor call in the default constructor should be called before anything else and the setter method should assign: this.p = p;

a) a[1] = 2 a[0] = 1
b) a[1] = 1 a[0] = 2
c) e1 = 2 e2 = 1
