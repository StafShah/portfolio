1.
a) No compile errors. Before JDK 1.5, generics were not introduced, which meant that ArrayList was a raw type and accepted any Object.
b) Compile error of incompatible types. ArrayList specifies that the list can only contain objects of type Date.

2.
a) Potential error if get retrieves a type different than Date as ArrayList can store any object.
b) The code is correct as the generic for the ArrayList ensures that get will return an object of type Date

3. Benefits of casting include type safety, elimination of explicit casting, improved readability, and reusability.

4. 
public interface Comparable<T> {
    int compareTo(T o);
}

5. No, such type parameters are erased during compilation. Instead:
public ArrayList() { }

6. Yes:
class Example<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;
}

7.
Generic type in class:
class Example<T> {
    private T value;
}

Generic type in instance method:
public <T> void method(T item) { }

8.
Generic static method:
public static <T> void method(T item) { }

Invoke generic static method:
MyClass.<String>method("Hello"); 

9. A bound generic type restricted to a specific range using extends or super.

10.
Unbounded wildcard allows any type.
Bounded wildcard allows a type or its subtypes.
Lower-bound wildcard allows a type or its supertypes.

11.
This replacement will only allow the two stacks to hold the same type. If they hold different types, a compile-time error will occur.

12.
This allows stack1 to hold any subtype of t, while stack2 can only hold type T. this allows any adds to stack2 to be safely casted.
