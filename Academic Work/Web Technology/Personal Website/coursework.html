    <img src="borgwarner.jpeg" alt="BorgWarner"/>
    <p><b>Description: </b>Developed the entirety of three full stack web applications for tracking the condition, repairs, and logistical data of work part carriers (WPCs) through the assembly line. Used Ignition SCADA software to design the applications with
    an HTML/CSS/JS-powered frontend designer, a Python and Java middle tier, and a SQL server database tier. In the inspection process, PLCs were also programmed to interact with the gateway server to provide insight on inspection data for the application to track and
    store within the database.</p>
